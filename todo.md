## Design TODO's:
<!-- Text is unnecessary large across the app, which makes it look a bit clunky.
* Try to vary the widths of the typeface.
Currently, it’s all bold everywhere. The font itself looks a bit toy like, maybe you can find something sleeker on Google Fonts and use that?
It appears that the typeface doesn’t even have multiple widths. This is a limiting factor for your design from the onset.
* On a green button, don’t use grey text — use a dark green or even black.
* Do the same for all other buttons (very dark red for the red one, etc.), while retaining contrast.
* Decide if you wanna go with skeuomorphic design (wooden background) or a more flat design (current buttons) -->
<!-- * I’d try out a linear gradient on the buttons and add a 0 0 0 Ypx box-shadow to add a nice border. -->
<!-- * Height of 7vh looks a bit more button like, too. -->
<!-- * Here’s an example of what you could do if you want to make them more skeuomorphic (Web 2.0 like). -->
<!-- * A more modern flat look you achieve by removing things like the gradient. -->
<!-- * In the game view itself, I’d remove the text-shadows from the red text and play with the color. -->
* The cards background is nice, the paws are cute, they give the game a whimsical feel, which I think is intended :-)
* Remove the spacing between the Player names.
* I think the overall cards area could use some padding around it.
